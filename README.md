# Covid-Vaccine-System-DB-Final-Project-NYU

The goal of this project is to build a web-based system for signing up people for COVID 19 vaccinations. The system includes 3 types of participants namely Patients, providers, 
and administrators. Patients can sign up in the system and provide personal information 
and preferences to assist with offering them vaccination appointments. Providers are 
places such as hospitals, doctorâ€™s offices etc., that provide vaccinations. Providers need 
to sign up with their information which will allow them to upload available vaccination 
appointments to the system. Finally, administrators of the database system define 
priority groups, assigns patients to these groups, makes sure that vaccination slots are 
allocated to patients based on priority and time preferences, and messages patients and 
providers about appointments. The following report seeks to outline in detail how the 
system will work based on the schema design and relational model. It will also provide 
some sample test data and queries to observe the model in action.
